# bot

My goal here is to create a properly working website redirect/autocheckout in order to purchase highly sought after items easier. Growing up I have always had interest in Sneakers and Clothing that was very hard to get unless you owned a "bot" and with some going for more than $150 I did my best to purchase the old fashioned way which produced rare success. 

From the front page of this application, users will enter username/email and password then be redirected to a page where they will see 2 input fields: "Product ID" "size"and then necessary info for billing info and shipping. Upon hitting submit the user will be redirected to supremenewyork.com where the code will run its magic and find the items and put into the cart and checkout quicker than a human can. 

This is valuable to me and other people and kids like me. I would love to keep this open source upon completion and share with my close friends. Having the skills I do now and my ability to research and dive into the necesaary information, completing this has become extremely realistic in my eyes. I will show anyone reviewing my project my: problem solving skills, coding talents, work ethic and most importantly the ability to take risks.
